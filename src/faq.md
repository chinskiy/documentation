???+ question "Is it support Windows?"
    Unfortunately not, it was designed for Linux only. You will need to use Docker or VM if you really want to run Osmedeus on Windows.


???+ question "What is the specification required to run Osmedeus?"
    I recommend using VPS since it takes a lot of network bandwidth, the minimum spec would be 1 CPU 2GB RAM. You can of course increase or decrease the threads in the workflow to make it work in any spec
